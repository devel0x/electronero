[size=14pt]🧬 Interchained: A Blockchain Built for Speed, Simplicity, and Signature Integrity[/size][/center]

[b]Interchained[/b] is a next-generation cryptocurrency and token platform designed to be fast, secure, and accessible. Combining [b]Yespower mining[/b], a lightweight [b]built-in token layer[/b], and a [b]post-halving SHA256 fork[/b], Interchained strikes a balance between decentralization, usability, and innovation.

[hr]

[size=14pt][b]🔑 Key Features[/b][/size]

[b]🔹 Hybrid Proof-of-Work[/b]
[+] 🧠 [b]Yespower[/b] for early blocks — CPU friendly, decentralized launch.
[+] ⚙️ [b]SHA256d[/b] after the fork — compatible with ASICs for long-term stability.
[+] ⛏️ Supports both solo miners and pools. Plug in your SHA256 ASICs post-fork.

[b]🔹 Difficulty Adjustment with DGW3[/b]
[+] ⚖️ [b]Dark Gravity Wave v3[/b] ensures smooth difficulty transitions.
[+] 🕒 Targets consistent 30s block times.

[b]🔹 Built-In Token Subsystem[/b]
[+] 💡 [b]No smart contracts[/b] — tokens are part of the core protocol.
[+] ⚙️ Supports: CREATE, TRANSFER, APPROVE, BURN, MINT, and more.
[+] 🔏 Each token action is signed with portable, deterministic messages using [i]BuildTokenMsg[/i].
[+] 🪙 Governance and byte-fee model to prevent spam and encourage responsible use.

[b]🔹 Signature-Based Operations[/b]
[+] Every token operation is cryptographically signed.
[+] Messages are portable across implementations and hardware wallets.
[+] Signature verification is enforced by the consensus layer for auditability and trust.

[size=14pt][b]📜 What Makes Interchained Different?[/b][/size]

Unlike bloated smart-contract chains, [b]Interchained keeps token logic clean and compact[/b]. There’s no virtual machine — just structured, signed operations that nodes interpret natively.

[+] 💨 [b]Gasless, deterministic, and offline signable[/b]  
[+] 📚 [b]Balances and allowances[/b] are maintained on-chain by the ledger  
[+] 🧾 [b]Token history and metadata[/b] are retrievable through RPC  
[+] 🔐 Works out-of-the-box with hardware wallets that support message signing

[size=14pt][b]📦 Example CLI Usage[/b][/size]
[i]Create a token[/i]
[code]interchained-cli createtoken "1000" "MyToken" "MTK" "8"[/code]

[i]Transfer tokens[/i]
[code]interchained-cli tokentransfer bob 0xtokenid "5.0"[/code]

[i]Approve a spender[/i]
[code]interchained-cli tokenapprove bob 0xtokenid "10"[/code]

[i]Query balances[/i]
[code]interchained-cli gettokenbalance 0xtokenid[/code]

✔️ Token operations are [b]signed locally[/b], [b]relayed P2P[/b], and [b]recorded immutably[/b].
